        <p>Good morning, my name is Travis Lathan Mclaurin. I am 20 years old, and was born and raised in Augusta, Georgia. I graduated from Lakeside High School in 2017 where I was an honor student and standout athlete. Once I completed high school, I enrolled at Augusta University to pursue a degree in Computer Science which I am currently working toward. I also am enrolled at code boot camp through the Clubhou.se at the Georgia Cyber Center. I decided to enroll in these programs to enable myself to learn sufficient material to help me in the work force upon graduation. I hope to obtain a job as a Security Analyst, and one day be promoted to a Security Administrator. </p>
